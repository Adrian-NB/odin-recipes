    <p><strong><em>THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF POZOLE ARE HOMINY, MEAT, AND A CHILE-SPIKED BROTH.</em></strong></p>
    
    <p>The backbone of the broth is a chile puree, which is made with dried chile peppers and a few ingredients you have in
        your pantry. Ancho and Guajillo peppers seem to be the peppers that are traditionally used, but we’re living in
        covid times, so mine looked a little different. I already had a pork shoulder thawed to make this, and had recently
        made a huge batch of chicken broth. I was 2/3 of the way to pozole, for the stew part, anyway. For the ingredients I
        was missing, I placed an Instacart order.
        Knowing that ingredient availability is a funny thing these days, I did a little experiment: I ordered every type of
        dried chile available at the store that had the largest variety. I ordered Chile del Arbol, chipotle, New Mexico,
        Guajillo, and Anaheim. My shopper was able to find all but the Arbol! Score.
        Feeling like I won the lottery (it’s the little things these days), I made the decision to make the chile sauce
        using all the chiles I got. I mean why not? You might have an excellent answer to this, and you might be screaming
        at your screen right now. But the result was great, so I don’t regret it.</p>
    
    <p><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>For the chile puree:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ounces assorted dried chiles</li>
        <li>4 large cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cocoa powder </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon ground clove</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong>For the Pozole:</strong></p>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon avocado oil</li>
        <li>3 pounds pork shoulder, excess fat removed and cut into 4–5 chunks</li>
        <li>3 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chile puree, plus more to taste</li>
        <li>1 15 ounce can hominy, drained and rinsed</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><strong><em>STEPS</em></strong></p>
    <p><strong>To make the chile puree:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>Tear off the tops of the chiles and pour out the seeds. Place in a large bowl and cover with 4 cups of very hot
            water. Cover with a plate and set aside for 20-30 minutes, until the chiles are soft.</li>
        <li>In a blender, puree until very smooth the chiles with the soaking water, garlic, cocoa powder, cumin, salt, and
            cloves.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <p><strong>To make the Pozole:</strong></p>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn the instant pot on sauté and adjust to high temp if it’s an option. Once the screen reads HOT, add the oil.
        </li>
        <li>Add the pork and sear until well browned on all sides, about 10-15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth and chile puree. Hit cancel and lock on the lid, making sure the seal is in place and the
            valve is set to sealing.
        </li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth and chile puree. Hit cancel and lock on the lid, making sure the seal is in place and the
            valve is set to sealing.
        </li>
        <li>Once the lid unlocks, add the hominy and turn to sauté. Boil for about 10 minutes, or until it’s reduced to your
            liking. Taste as it cooks and adjust with additional chile puree if desired.
        </li>
        <li>Serve with shredded cabbage, sliced radishes, lime wedges, oregano, and additional chile puree
        </li>
    </ol>
