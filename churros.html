    <p><strong><em>Easy Homemade Churros</em></strong></p>
    
    <p>You can find a type of fried dough in nearly every cuisine, and one of my favorites is the Spanish churro. Many
        countries have adopted the churro since its creation, but in Spain, you can dip them in coffee for breakfast or
        enjoy with a chocolate sauce as dessert. My recipe is a hybrid of the Mexican version, which is characteristically
        rolled in cinnamon sugar, and the Spanish version, which, as I said, is served with a chocolate dipping sauce and
        omits the cinnamon. Why not have the best of both worlds? I don't often feel like breaking out oil to fry things,
        but when you have an easy churro recipe this delicious, it's absolutely worth it. They only take a few minutes to
        fry and will actually still taste good hours later at room temperature, making them a great party dessert!</p>

            <li>3/4 c. dark chocolate chips</li>
            <li>3/4 c. heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>

        </ul>

    <p><strong><em>STEPS</em></strong></p>
   
    <ol>
       
        <p><em>For Churros</em></p>
            <li>In a large saucepan over medium heat, bring butter, 2 tablespoons sugar, and 1 cup water to a boil, then stir in
            vanilla. Remove from heat and add flour and salt. Stir with a wooden spoon until thickened, about 30 seconds.
            Let cool 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, on a rimmed baking sheet or large plate, mix cinnamon and remaining 1 cup sugar.
            </li>
            <li>Using a handheld mixer on medium speed, add eggs one at a time, beating to blend after each addition. Transfer
            mixture to a piping bag fitted with a large open star tip.
            </li>
            <li>Into a large pot fitted with a deep-fry thermometer, pour oil to come halfway up sides. Heat over medium-high
            heat until thermometer registers 375°. Holding piping bag a few inches above oil, carefully pipe churros into
            6"-long ropes. Using kitchen scissors, cut off dough from piping bag.
            </li>
            <li>Working in batches, fry churros, turning as needed, until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes; make sure oil registers
            375° between batches. Using a slotted spoon or tongs, immediately roll churros in cinnamon sugar, then transfer
            to a wire rack.
            </li>
        
        <p><em>Chocolate Dipping Sauce</em></p>
            <li>Place chocolate chips in a medium heatproof bowl. In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring cream to a simmer.
            Pour hot cream over chips and let sit 2 minutes. Add cinnamon and salt and whisk until combined and smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Arrange churros on a platter. Serve with dipping sauce alongside.
            </li>
